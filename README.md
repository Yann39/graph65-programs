# About the project

<img alt="Casio logo" src="doc/logo-casio.svg" height="42"/>

I just keep there some old programs I wrote (in French language) for my **Casio Graph 65** calculator when I was in high school (2003/2004).

It includes some basic programs for **Electrotechnics**, **Mathematics**, and **Physics** courses.

Very helpful for exams :)

# The Casio Graph 65

<img alt="Casio calculator photo" src="doc/casio-calculator.jpeg" height="256"/>

The **Casio Graph 65** was a mid-range digital graphing calculator.
Its wide range of functions and program library was perfect for science courses and non-science higher education.

It allowed to create and run programs written in a programming language called **Casio BASIC**,
which is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted specifically for Casio calculators.
It was designed for ease of use in mathematical and scientific calculations and included syntax and commands tailored to the calculatorâ€™s hardware.

# Programs

> [!NOTE]
> The programs are provided in _.fxi_ format in the _programs_ directory, I also provided the sources as _.txt_ files just in case.
